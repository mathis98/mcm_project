Executive summary
-----------------

This distribution contains code to reproduce the results in:
    Elliptical slice Sampling
    Iain Murray, Ryan P. Adams and David J.C. MacKay
    Published in AISTATS 2010.

Although this looks like a large code dump, the entire method proposed by the
paper is implemented in the short stand-alone function:

    gppu_elliptical.m

See documentation therein for more information. The rest of the code is all for
constructing the comparison in the paper. We are particularly grateful to
Michalis Titsias for providing his code for comparison.


Distribution
------------

gppu_elliptical.m and other code written by the authors of the paper is
available under the standard MIT license. However, various other files by other
authors are included. For full attributions and license terms see COPYING.


Running the experiments
-----------------------

The experiment runs are large and many, and will require substantial time,
memory and disk to reproduce. This is only because we had enough machines so
that we could do this easily and it made a nice noiseless figure. Much shorter
runs would probably do for many purposes.

You will need to obtain the datasets we used:
loadBinaryUSPS.m from http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/data/ requires
that you download usps_resampled.mat into the data directory.
You can create data/synthetic.mat by running gen_synthetic.m

Dependencies:
-------------

As it says in the paper, we ran this code on Matlab 7.8. Somewhat earlier
versions will work, but 7.x is probably required. It should all work in recent
versions of Octave too, although this hasn't been tested for a while. Some of
the code to run the experiments may depend on Un*x (Linux/Mac) in a trivial way.

effective_size_rcoda.m depends on R and R-CODA being installed and in your path.
We don't have a Windows machine with R to get the system calls working there.

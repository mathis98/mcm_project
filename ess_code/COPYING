Most of the code in this distribution is attributed to one or more authors. The
code in this directory -- EXCEPT within the titsias subdirectory -- that is
unattributed (mainly uninteresting code to set up our particular experiments)
was written by Iain Murray and Ryan P. Adams.

The code written by us may be used freely under the standard, permissive MIT
license, copied below. However, some of the code is written by other authors and
distributed under different terms. Full details are given in the rest of this
